Hi, I'm Timonwa and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria.
I'm a self-taught frontend developer currently mastering the skills one step at a time.
My Frontend skills are something good to write home about.

My fault is Responsive Design, I just love to see a page I create have awesome responsiveness on both larger and smaller screens.

I also write notes on my blog, [Timonwa's Notes](https://blog.timonwa.com) on web development that help beginners have an easier learning journey.

I am passionate about making the web accessible to everyone because I believe that everyone irrespective of their disability deserves the right to a good user experience on the web.

I am building an opensource project/community called [Tech Roadmap](https://careerroadmap.tech) which aims to provide free online resources in the different formats that are specially 
curated to form roadmaps or guidelines on the different careers in the tech industry. You can view the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap).

My current technical skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sass, Reactjs, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Git, GitHub, VsCode. And I'm currently learning VueJs and Bulma Css.

**Random Fact:** I love to surf the web for random and new things to learn, no knowledge is ever wasted. That is how I stumbled unto Tech and now *the journey is never ending*.
