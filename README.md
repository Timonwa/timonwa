Hi, I'm Timonwa, and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. :wave:

I'm a self-taught front-end developer with 3 years of experience delivering exceptional user experiences and innovative web solutions.
I'm passionate about responsive web design and user-centric design principles, and I excel at bringing designs to life and creating seamless user experiences.

My current technical skills include:
- **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SCSS, Markdown
- **CSS Frameworks/Libraries**: Styled-components, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, Chakra UI
- **Js Frameworks/Libraries**: ReactJs, Next.js, Vue.js, Redux Toolkit, Zustand
- **Version Control and Collaboration**: Git, GitHub, Jira, Slack, Notion, Trello
- **Development Tools and Services**: VsCode, Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, Storybook, Playwright
- **Design and Documentation**: Figma, Canva, Google Docs, Dropbox

I also write notes on my blog, [Timonwa's Notes](https://blog.timonwa.com), which is all about simplifying complex topics and helping developers on their learning journey. I write by putting the readers first while at the same time ensuring that every critical piece of information is passed to them. I also write for companies like [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/pelumiakintokun/) and [Turing](https://www.turing.com/kb/how-to-debug-react).

When I'm not sharing knowledge, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, and reading comics on Instagram. I also volunteer my time to the tech community to teach, mentor, or speak at Twitter spaces. Furthermore, I manage an open-source project called [Tech Roadmap](https://techroadmap.xyz), which provides free online resources to guide individuals through various careers in the tech industry. You can view the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap) and give us a :star:.

**Random Fact:** I love to surf the web for random and new things to learn; no knowledge is ever wasted. That is how I stumbled into Tech, and now *the journey is never-ending*.
