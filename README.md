Hi, I'm Timonwa, and I'm from Lagos, Nigeria. :wave:

I'm a self-taught front-end developer currently mastering the skills one step at a time.
My Frontend skills are exceptional.
My fault is Responsive Design; I just love to see a page I create have excellent responsiveness on both larger and smaller screens. 
(Yes, I love CSS and love making responsive web designs and building reusable web components.) :grin: 

My current technical skills include:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown
- Sass, Styled-components, Ant Design, Tailwind, Bootstrap
- ReactJs, NextJs, Redux ToolKit, VueJs, NuxtJs, Vuex
- Git, GitHub,
- VsCode, Figma,
- Trello, Notion, Slack, Google Docs.

I also write notes on my blog, [Timonwa's Notes](https://blog.timonwa.com), on frontend development that help beginners have a more accessible learning journey.
I write by putting the end-users first while at the same time ensuring that every critical piece of information is passed to them. I break complex topics and concepts into the simplest of terms and pay attention to details, especially regarding the grammatical structure and tone of my writing. I also write for companies like LogRocket and UploadCare. I'm currently learning about API documentation, and I'm open to writing on it.

I am passionate about making the web accessible to everyone because I believe that everyone, irrespective of their disability, deserves the right to a good user experience on the web.

I am building an open source project called [Tech Roadmap](https://techroadmap.xyz), which aims to provide free online resources in different formats specially 
curated to form roadmaps or guidelines on the different careers in the tech industry. You can view the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Timonwa/techroadmap) and give us a :star:.

In my spare time, I contribute to other open-source projects and volunteer my technical skills to the tech community.

**Random Fact:** I love to surf the web for random and new things to learn, no knowledge is ever wasted. That is how I stumbled unto Tech and now *the journey is never ending*.
